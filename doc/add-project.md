# Add Environment to Tenant Space

* [Back to index](../README.md)

## Description

This task adds a environment to a tenant space.  Within this context, this will correspond to a project with the flatten project name of 9[cluster]-[tenant_name]-[environment_name] (e.g nonprod-sometenant-test where sometenant is the name of the tenancy and test is the name of the environment).

## Behaviour

The Add Environment to Tenant Space behaviour is the same as [Create Tenant](./create-tenant.md).  In this scenario, the supplied parameters should reflect the new required environment.

See  [Create Tenant](./create-tenant.md)
